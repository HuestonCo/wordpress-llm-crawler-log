Automatically track ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity & 27 AI bots crawling your WordPress site. Monitor AI search engine visits, detect AI web scrapers & optimize for LLMO.

== Description ==

**Is ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or Gemini crawling your website? This plugin automatically tracks every AI bot visit to give you the data you need! 🤖**

LLM Bot Tracker is the most comprehensive AI crawler analytics plugin for WordPress, providing automatic 24/7 monitoring of artificial intelligence bots, search crawlers, and web scrapers accessing your content.

= 🎯 How It Works =

**Install → Activate → Done!**

That's it. The plugin immediately starts tracking all AI bot activity in the background. No configuration needed. View your data anytime in the admin dashboard at **Tools > LLM Crawler Logs**.

= 🚀 Why Track AI Bots & Crawlers? =

The web is changing. AI-powered search engines like Perplexity, You.com, and SearchGPT are revolutionizing how people find information. Traditional SEO isn't enough anymore - you need **LLMO (Large Language Model Optimization)**.

**This plugin automatically captures:**
* **Every AI bot visit** - Timestamp, bot name, pages accessed, IP address
* **AI crawler patterns** - Which content AI systems value most
* **Training data usage** - When GPT, Claude, or Gemini scrape your content  
* **Crawl frequency** - How often each AI system visits
* **Geographic origins** - Where AI bot traffic originates
* **Response codes** - Success rates and errors for AI crawlers

Without this data, you're flying blind in the AI era of search.

No! LLM Bot Tracker runs efficiently in the background with zero impact on visitor experience. It typically adds less than 0.01 seconds to page processing - completely unnoticeable.

= Does this track human visitors? =
No. The plugin exclusively tracks identified AI/LLM crawlers and bots. It does not track, store, or process any human visitor data, making it 100% GDPR compliant.

= Which AI bots and crawlers can it detect? =
The plugin tracks exactly 27 AI/LLM bots:

**OpenAI:** GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, OAI-SearchBot
**Anthropic:** ClaudeBot, Claude-Web, Claude-SearchBot, Claude-User

**Meta AI:** Meta-ExternalAgent, Meta-ExternalFetcher
**Others:** MistralAI-User, Devin, LinerBot, QualifiedBot, Bytespider, CCBot, Omgilibot, Omgili, Applebot-Extended, ProRataInc

We continuously update detection patterns as new AI agents are released.

= How do I view the tracking data? =
Go to **Tools > LLM Crawler Logs** in your WordPress admin. You'll see all AI bot activity, with powerful filtering and analysis tools. No external service or account needed.

= Can I block unwanted AI bots? =
The plugin provides the data you need to make informed blocking decisions. View bot activity in the admin dashboard, identify unwanted bots, then add them to your robots.txt file. Example:
```
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /

User-agent: CCBot
Disallow: /
```

= How accurate is the bot detection? =
Very accurate. We use official user agent strings published by AI companies and verify against known IP ranges when possible. The plugin updates its detection patterns automatically.

= Where is my data stored? =
All data is stored locally in your WordPress database. No external services, no API calls, no third-party dependencies. You have complete control and privacy.

= Can I export the tracking data? =
Data is fully accessible via the admin interface with advanced filtering. CSV export is coming in version 1.4. Data is stored in standard WordPress tables for SQL access if needed.

= Does it work with caching plugins? =
Yes! Bot detection happens at the WordPress core level before any caching. Works perfectly with WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, and all major caching plugins.

= How much data does it store? =
The plugin intelligently manages data storage with automatic log rotation. Typically uses less than 10MB even with millions of bot hits. Old data is automatically pruned to maintain performance.

= How often do you add new bot detection? =
We monitor the AI industry constantly and typically add new bot detection within 2 weeks of public announcements. Updates happen automatically - you don't need to do anything.

= Do the display shortcodes slow down my pages? =
No. The optional display shortcodes use smart caching and only load CSS when used. They're completely optional - the core tracking works without them.

= Is this better than server log analysis? =
Yes! This plugin provides WordPress-specific context that server logs miss: page titles, post types, taxonomies, and more. Plus it's accessible directly in your WordPress admin without technical knowledge.

= What's the difference between this and Google Analytics? =
Google Analytics focuses on human visitors and conversions. LLM Bot Tracker specifically tracks AI bots and crawlers that Google Analytics ignores. They complement each other perfectly.

= Do I need technical knowledge to use this? =
No! The plugin is designed to be completely automatic. Install it and forget it. The data is presented in an easy-to-understand format in your WordPress admin.
