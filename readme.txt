== Description ==

**Is ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or Gemini crawling your website? This plugin automatically tracks every AI bot visit to give you the data you need! 🤖**

LLM Bot Tracker is the most comprehensive AI crawler analytics plugin for WordPress, providing automatic 24/7 monitoring of artificial intelligence bots, search crawlers, and web scrapers accessing your content.

= 🎯 How It Works =

**Install → Activate → Done!**

That's it. The plugin immediately starts tracking all AI bot activity in the background. No configuration needed. View your data anytime in the admin dashboard at **Tools > LLM Crawler Logs**.

= 🚀 Why Track AI Bots & Crawlers? =

The web is changing. AI-powered search engines like Perplexity, You.com, and SearchGPT are revolutionizing how people find information. Traditional SEO isn't enough anymore - you need **LLMO (Large Language Model Optimization)**.

**This plugin automatically captures:**
* **Every AI bot visit** - Timestamp, bot name, pages accessed, IP address
* **AI crawler patterns** - Which content AI systems value most
* **Training data usage** - When GPT, Claude, or Gemini scrape your content  
* **Crawl frequency** - How often each AI system visits
* **Geographic origins** - Where AI bot traffic originates
* **Response codes** - Success rates and errors for AI crawlers

Without this data, you're flying blind in the AI era of search.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it require any configuration? =
No! The plugin starts tracking immediately upon activation. It's completely automatic. Just install, activate, and check your data whenever you want at Tools > LLM Crawler Logs.

= Will this slow down my website? =
No! LLM Bot Tracker runs efficiently in the background with zero impact on visitor experience. It typically adds less than 0.01 seconds to page processing - completely unnoticeable.

= Does this track human visitors? =
No. The plugin exclusively tracks identified AI/LLM crawlers and bots. It does not track, store, or process any human visitor data, making it 100% GDPR compliant.

= Which AI bots and crawlers can it detect? =
Currently 25+ including GPTBot (ChatGPT), ClaudeBot (Anthropic), PerplexityBot, CCBot, Bytespider (TikTok), Google-Extended, Gemini, Meta AI bots, Bingbot, You.com bot, and many more. Detection updates are added automatically.

= How do I view the tracking data? =
Go to **Tools > LLM Crawler Logs** in your WordPress admin. You'll see all AI bot activity, with powerful filtering and analysis tools. No external service or account needed.

= Can I block unwanted AI bots? =
The plugin provides the data you need to make informed blocking decisions. View bot activity in the admin dashboard, identify unwanted bots, then add them to your robots.txt file. Example:
```
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /

User-agent: CCBot
Disallow: /
```

= How accurate is the bot detection? =
Very accurate. We use official user agent strings published by AI companies and verify against known IP ranges when possible. The plugin updates its detection patterns automatically.

= Where is my data stored? =
All data is stored locally in your WordPress database. No external services, no API calls, no third-party dependencies. You have complete control and privacy.

= Can I export the tracking data? =
Data is fully accessible via the admin interface with advanced filtering. CSV export is coming in version 1.4. Data is stored in standard WordPress tables for SQL access if needed.

= Does it work with caching plugins? =
Yes! Bot detection happens at the WordPress core level before any caching. Works perfectly with WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, and all major caching plugins.

= How much data does it store? =
The plugin intelligently manages data storage with automatic log rotation. Typically uses less than 10MB even with millions of bot hits. Old data is automatically pruned to maintain performance.

= How often do you add new bot detection? =
We monitor the AI industry constantly and typically add new bot detection within 2 weeks of public announcements. Updates happen automatically - you don't need to do anything.

= Do the display shortcodes slow down my pages? =
No. The optional display shortcodes use smart caching and only load CSS when used. They're completely optional - the core tracking works without them.

= Is this better than server log analysis? =
Yes! This plugin provides WordPress-specific context that server logs miss: page titles, post types, taxonomies, and more. Plus it's accessible directly in your WordPress admin without technical knowledge.

= What's the difference between this and Google Analytics? =
Google Analytics focuses on human visitors and conversions. LLM Bot Tracker specifically tracks AI bots and crawlers that Google Analytics ignores. They complement each other perfectly.

= Do I need technical knowledge to use this? =
No! The plugin is designed to be completely automatic. Install it and forget it. The data is presented in an easy-to-understand format in your WordPress admin.
